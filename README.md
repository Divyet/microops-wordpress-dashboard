# MicroOps – Internal Operations Dashboard

MicroOps is a WordPress-based internal operations dashboard built to explore WordPress as an application framework rather than just a blogging platform.

## Background
This project was created as a practical exercise to understand how WordPress can be used to model internal systems such as task tracking, documentation management, and role-based access for small teams.

## Core Features
- Centralized dashboard homepage
- Task modeling using posts and categories (status and priority)
- Internal documentation section
- Clear separation of user roles (admin, manager, contributor)
- Recent tasks overview for quick visibility

## Design Decisions
Due to WordPress.com free plan limitations, custom post types and server-side code were not used. Instead:
- Tasks are modeled using WordPress posts
- Categories represent task status and priority
- Pages are used for fixed system sections

This approach demonstrates constraint-aware system design.

## Skills Demonstrated
- WordPress content modeling
- Web development fundamentals
- System design under platform constraints
- Clean UX focused on clarity and usability
